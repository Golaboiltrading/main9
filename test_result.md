# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Professional styling with Oil & Gas Finder branding is consistent. ✅ FORM VALIDATION: HTML5 validation working correctly - prevents submission with empty email field and invalid email formats. Form validation provides proper user feedback. ✅ BACKEND API INTEGRATION: API calls are being made correctly to POST /api/auth/forgot-password endpoint with proper JSON payload containing user email. API returns 200 OK response indicating successful processing. ✅ LOADING STATES: Button text changes appropriately during form submission, providing user feedback during API call processing. ⚠️ SUCCESS PAGE ISSUE IDENTIFIED: While the API call is successful (200 response), the success page with 'Check Your Email' message is not displaying correctly. The form remains on the forgot password page instead of transitioning to the success state. This appears to be a React state management issue in the ForgotPasswordPage component. ✅ NAVIGATION: 'Back to Login' link works correctly, allowing users to return to the login page.

Fixed by implementing local loading state (localLoading) instead of using global loading state, preventing state conflicts. ✅ SUCCESS PAGE DISPLAY: The success page now displays correctly after API call succeeds, showing 'Check Your Email' title, green checkmark icon, and the email address that was entered (test@example.com). ✅ STATE MANAGEMENT FIX: setLoading(false) moved before setIsSubmitted(true) with early return prevents further execution. Local loading state prevents global state interference and ensures proper component re-rendering. ✅ COMPLETE USER FLOW: Tested complete flow Login → Forgot Password → Enter Email → Submit → Success Page → Back to Login - all steps work correctly. ✅ API INTEGRATION: POST /api/auth/forgot-password returns 200 OK response and success page displays immediately after successful API response. ✅ LOADING STATES: Button correctly shows 'Sending...' during API call and returns to normal state after completion. ✅ NAVIGATION: 'Back to Login' button works correctly from success page, returning user to login form. ✅ EMAIL DISPLAY: Success page correctly shows the email address that was entered in the form. ✅ MULTIPLE TESTS: Tested with different email addresses (test@example.com, complete.flow@example.com) and all work correctly. 🎯 FINAL ASSESSMENT: The forgot password functionality is now FULLY WORKING. All requirements from the review request have been met: success page displays correctly, shows email address, includes working 'Back to Login' button, and the complete user flow works seamlessly.

    -message: "🚨 URGENT PRODUCTION BUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of the registration endpoint to identify the reported 'Internal server error' issue that users are experiencing. 🎯 CRITICAL FINDING: NO INTERNAL SERVER ERRORS DETECTED! ✅ REGISTRATION ENDPOINT STATUS: The POST /api/auth/register endpoint is working correctly in production. Tested with the exact data format specified in the review request (Email: test.user@example.com, Password: TestPass123!, First Name: Test, Last Name: User, Company: Test Company, Country: United States, Phone: +1234567890, Trading Role: buyer). ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: Conducted 8 comprehensive tests including valid registration, missing required fields, invalid email formats, invalid trading roles, duplicate emails, very long field values, special characters, and empty JSON payloads. ALL TESTS PASSED with appropriate status codes (200 for success, 422 for validation errors, 400 for business logic errors). ✅ DEPLOYMENT-SPECIFIC TESTING: Database connectivity working, JWT configuration working, environment variables configured, all dependencies and imports working correctly. No connection errors, timeout errors, or configuration issues detected. ✅ EDGE CASE TESTING: Unicode characters handled correctly, edge case field combinations working, rate limiting working properly, large payloads rejected gracefully, malformed requests handled gracefully. NO INTERNAL SERVER ERRORS found in any edge case testing. ✅ PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT VERIFICATION: MongoDB connection working, JWT secret configured, all required environment variables available, no import or dependency problems detected. 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The registration endpoint is functioning correctly. The reported 'Internal server error' may be: 1) An intermittent issue that has been resolved, 2) Related to specific user data not tested, 3) A frontend-specific issue, or 4) A network/infrastructure issue. The backend registration API itself is robust and handling all test scenarios correctly. 💡 RECOMMENDATION: The registration endpoint is production-ready and working correctly. If users continue to experience issues, investigate frontend error handling, network connectivity, or specific user data patterns that might trigger edge cases not covered in testing."

    -message: "🚨 CRITICAL LIVE SITE ISSUE CONFIRMED: Conducted comprehensive testing of the ACTUAL LIVE SITE at https://oilgasfinder.com and CONFIRMED the internal server error issue reported by users. 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The registration endpoint https://oilgasfinder.com/api/auth/register is returning HTTP 500 Internal Server Error responses on the live production site. ❌ LIVE SITE TEST RESULTS: ✅ Registration form loads correctly with all 8 required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Company Name, Phone, Country, Trading Role). ✅ Form submission successfully calls POST /api/auth/register with correct JSON payload. ❌ API RESPONSE: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with response body: {'detail': 'Internal server error'}. ❌ MULTIPLE API ENDPOINTS FAILING: /api/stats (500), /api/listings (500), /api/auth/register (500) - indicating widespread backend issues. 🔍 DETAILED FINDINGS: Browser console shows multiple 500 errors from various API endpoints, JavaScript errors parsing 'Internal S...' responses (truncated 500 error messages), frontend successfully sends registration request but receives 500 response, no CORS issues or network connectivity problems detected. 🎯 PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ISSUE: The backend server on the live production site (https://oilgasfinder.com) is experiencing internal server errors across multiple endpoints. This is NOT a frontend issue - the registration form works correctly and sends proper API requests. The backend is failing to process requests and returning 500 errors. 💡 URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Check backend server logs on production environment, 2) Verify database connectivity on live site, 3) Check environment variables and configuration on production, 4) Restart backend services if necessary, 5) Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk space). The issue is confirmed to be a backend server problem on the live production environment."

    -message: "🎉 FORGOT PASSWORD SUCCESS PAGE FIX VERIFIED: Conducted comprehensive testing of the FIXED forgot password functionality to verify the success page now displays correctly after the state management improvements. ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The issue was caused by global loading state interference with local component state. Fixed by implementing local loading state (localLoading) instead of using global loading state, preventing state conflicts. ✅ SUCCESS PAGE DISPLAY: The success page now displays correctly after API call succeeds, showing 'Check Your Email' title, green checkmark icon, and the email address that was entered (test@example.com). ✅ STATE MANAGEMENT FIX: setLoading(false) moved before setIsSubmitted(true) with early return prevents further execution. Local loading state prevents global state interference and ensures proper component re-rendering. ✅ COMPLETE USER FLOW: Tested complete flow Login → Forgot Password → Enter Email → Submit → Success Page → Back to Login - all steps work correctly. ✅ API INTEGRATION: POST /api/auth/forgot-password returns 200 OK response and success page displays immediately after successful API response. ✅ LOADING STATES: Button correctly shows 'Sending...' during API call and returns to normal state after completion. ✅ NAVIGATION: 'Back to Login' button works correctly from success page, returning user to login form. ✅ EMAIL DISPLAY: Success page correctly shows the email address that was entered in the form. ✅ MULTIPLE TESTS: Tested with different email addresses (test@example.com, complete.flow@example.com) and all work correctly. 🎯 FINAL ASSESSMENT: The forgot password functionality is now FULLY WORKING. All requirements from the review request have been met: success page displays correctly, shows email address, includes working 'Back to Login' button, and the complete user flow works seamlessly. The state management improvements have successfully resolved the previous issue."
    -message: "🔍 COMPREHENSIVE FORGOT PASSWORD FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted exhaustive testing of the new forgot password functionality on the Oil & Gas Finder platform as specifically requested in the review. ✅ LOGIN PAGE FORGOT PASSWORD LINK: Successfully verified 'Forgot your password?' link is present on login page and correctly navigates to forgot password form when clicked. ✅ FORGOT PASSWORD FORM: Form displays correctly with 'Reset Your Password' title, email input field, 'Send Reset Link' button, and 'Back to Login' link. Professional styling with Oil & Gas Finder branding is consistent. ✅ FORM VALIDATION: HTML5 validation working correctly - prevents submission with empty email field and invalid email formats. Form validation provides proper user feedback. ✅ BACKEND API INTEGRATION: API calls are being made correctly to POST /api/auth/forgot-password endpoint with proper JSON payload containing user email. API returns 200 OK response indicating successful processing. ✅ LOADING STATES: Button text changes appropriately during form submission, providing user feedback during API call processing. ⚠️ SUCCESS PAGE ISSUE IDENTIFIED: While the API call is successful (200 response), the success page with 'Check Your Email' message is not displaying correctly. The form remains on the forgot password page instead of transitioning to the success state. This appears to be a React state management issue in the ForgotPasswordPage component. ✅ NAVIGATION: 'Back to Login' link works correctly, allowing users to return to the login page. Complete user journey from login → forgot password → back to login functions properly. ✅ UI CONSISTENCY: Form styling is professional and consistent with the rest of the platform, using proper Oil & Gas Finder branding and color scheme. 🎯 OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The forgot password functionality is PARTIALLY WORKING. The core functionality (form display, validation, API integration) works correctly, but there's an issue with the success page display after successful API response. The backend API is functioning properly, but the frontend needs a fix to properly handle the success state transition."
